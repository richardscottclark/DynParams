BuzzMaven Dynamic Parameters
Add the code above into the header or footer of your website or landing page. (Before the <head> tags or after the <body> tags.)

Take the final URL of your page and add “?dynamic=01” to the end of it. Example: “http://yourdomain.com/landing-page/?dynamic=01”

If you want to display the second headline option from the code above you can change the 01 to 02. Example: “http://yourdomain.com/landing-page/?dynamic=02” This will display “Headline 2” instead.

Updated the default headline also you want to show when people visit your URL without the “?dynamic=” added.

Give your headline an id=headline. (ex. <h1 id=”headline”>My headline</h1>). If you’re using a landing page tool that doesn’t let you change the id of your headline, check the instruction below on how to target a specific headline.
